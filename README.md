# Spinner
     In Android, Spinner provides a quick way to select one value from a set of values. 
     Android spinners are nothing but the drop down-list.

Syntax :

     <Spinner
        android:id="@+id/simpleSpinner "
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
        
        
# Important Note: 

• Spinner is associated with Adapter view so to fill the data in spinner we need to use one of the Adapter class.        

• To fill the data in a spinner we need to implement an adapter class. A spinner is mainly used to display only text field so we can implement Array Adapter for that.

• We can also use Base Adapter and other custom adapters to display a spinner with more customize list.

• Suppose if we need to display a textview and a imageview in spinner item list then array adapter is not enough for that. Here we have to implement custom adapter in our class. 

• Below image of Spinner and Custom Spinner will make it more clear.
